# LFSR-implementation-in-VDHL

1.	Implement a 6-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to generate pseudorandom numbers.
2.	Simulate the design using ModelSim and verify functionality with testbenches.
3.	Program an FPGA board to visualize the LFSR output on LEDs and extend the design to make an LED turn ON, when a button is pressed.
